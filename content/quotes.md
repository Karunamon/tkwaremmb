*In response to someone refusing to check a source because of the source's biases:*  

>Fortunately in this year 2015 we have a thing called hyperlinks via which evidence for assertions can be easily provided. If you treat op-eds from 'unreliable' sources as unreliable, fine. If you refuse to even check well-cited articles from 'unreliable' sources, you're probably more interested in ideological correctness than truth.

*In response to "racism and sexism" on Reddit*  

>You hang out with racists and sexists in real life and online. You just are not comfortable acknowledging that others can have opinions you consider racist and sexist and still be human. Were you to actually probe your friends about their beliefs, you'd likely come across some that have beliefs that are incredibly sexist in your view, and that's okay.
>For example, some of my friends believe that spaces need to be made 'safe' for women, and that means you cannot make any joke that references rape. Some of my friends are dark humored rape survivors, and find spaces where they cannot make those comments unsafe. I am friends with both of them, and they are friends with each other, despite disagreeing vehemently on what and where those spaces are. When they are around each other, neither of them can consider the space they reside 'safe', and yet, they survive.
